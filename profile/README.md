# Engli Language

Engli is a community fork of English with these benefits (among others):
- 💥 **0 collisions** &mdash; no words will sound identical, and English words with multiple meanings that differ too much will be split into multiple words
- 🧱 **Phonetically rigid** &mdash; each letter only has one sound, and the letters surrounding it have no impact on that
- 🤔 **0 ambiguity** &mdash; there is only one way to spell any word, and only one way to pronounce it
- 👥 **Community-driven** &mdash; syntax and words are decided by community vote
- ❄️ **0 inconsistency** &mdash; prefixes and suffixes will stay separate from a word, like "multi-player" instead of "multiplayer"
- 🌐 **International** &mdash; no more divide between "center" and "centre", "sentr" is used instead
- ⚡ **Faster to type in** &mdash; most words are shorter, which allows you to type faster

It builds upon English, with all its idioms and expressions, but makes changes that improve upon many flaws of the language and aim to make it easier to use, faster to type/speak in, and easier to learn.
